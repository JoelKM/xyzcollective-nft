            <h3>TEN YEARS AGO, THE COUNTDOWN STARTED.</h3>
            <p>
                After thousands years of destruction, humanity’s home was finally reaching it’s last days. The atmosphere was slowly collapsing in on itself, in turn creating a mixture of poisonous gases that could wipe out the entire population within hours of exposure.
            </p>
            <p>The only way to survive was to adapt.</p>
            <h3>AT FIRST IT, WAS JUST AN IDEA.</h3>
            <p>
                Creating an exo-suit that somehow filtered the poisonous air well enough for human consumption seemed farfetched as a plan, but they didn’t have many ideas left.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the end, thousands were produced only a year before the apocalypse.
            </p>
            <h3>BY THAT TIME.</h3>
            <p>
                By that time, the hints of Earth’s demise were starting to show. Many cities were underwater, and the sky had gained a permanent purple hue. Crops stopped growing and only genetically modified plants were able to thrive, - if only for a short time.
            </p>
            <h3>THE FACTORY.</h3>
            <p>
                The Factory was working on producing as many suits as possible with the limited manpower and resources they had. It was a hurried process, perhaps rushed as well, which later would lead to what people called “The Beginning of the End.”
